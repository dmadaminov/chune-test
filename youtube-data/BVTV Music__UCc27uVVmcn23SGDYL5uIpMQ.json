I won’t lie\nThere’s no exception here in this time\n\nThe heavens don’t remember you\nI think it’s time to go\n\nDon’t pretend that you’re my angel\nWhen you drag me straight to hell\nYou fly on broken wings with all of my dreams\nWhen you drag me straight to hell\n\nThose scars have taken over what was your heart\nNow you hate everyone that’s not what you are\n\nAll my life I’ve been addicted to the wrong side\nEvery road we took I despised\nSo this time you won’t take me down\n\nDon’t pretend that you’re my angel\nWhen you drag me straight to hell\nYou fly on broken wings with all of my dreams\nWhen you drag me straight to hell\n\nThose eyes were like the poison deep in my mind\nThose eyes were like the poison deep in my mind\nDon’t pretend you’re right\n\nDon’t pretend that you’re my angel\nWhen you drag me straight to hell\nYou fly on broken wings with all of my dreams\nWhen you drag me straight to hell","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zLyogXH1Ng/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zLyogXH1Ng/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zLyogXH1Ng/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zLyogXH1Ng/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zLyogXH1Ng/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BVTV Music","playlistId":"UUc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","position":21,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5zLyogXH1Ng"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/lUPqdoJpbbzRBYo-AYbNxzVEnts\"","id":"VVVjMjd1VlZtY24yM1NHRFlMNXVJcE1RLjJvLTkwU2JBZXRz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-23T20:01:41.000Z","channelId":"UCc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","title":"On Letting Go - \"Dust in the Wind\" (Official Live Music Video)","description":"On Letting Go are back with the official live music video for their latest single \"Dust in the Wind,\" exclusively on BVTV Music!\n\nDebut EP 'Reading Between the Lines' available NOW at:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/reading-between-the-lines-ep/id1188545518\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/7FaBhaAQ6xyc4DXc3RNwva\n\nVideo produced by: Zach Herrbach\nMusic produced by: Shawn Christmas\n\nCheck out more from On Letting Go at:\nhttps://www.olgofficial.com\nhttps://www.Facebook.com/OfficialOLG\nhttps://www.Twitter.com/OnLettingGoFL\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/OnLettingGoOfficial\nhttps://www.districtlines.com/OnLettingGo\n\nFollow BVTV at:\nYOUTUBE: http://www.YouTube.com/BVTV\nTWITTER: http://www.Twitter.com/BVTV\nFACEBOOK: http://www.Facebook.com/BVTVmusic\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.Instagram.com/BVTVmusic\n\nLyrics:\nI'm falling into your eyes again\nBut this isn't how it was supposed to end\nHow will you remember me when I am far out of reach?\nI'm just dust in the wind\n\nSo slow down and take a second to look back\nAnd wallow in your lies until you realize\n\nLife starts and ends the same\nExcept the choices that you make every day\nThat echo in the end, that you live with on your deathbed\nIf you could do it again how would you do it then?\nWould you change anything?\nOr would you change everything\n\nI'm falling into your eyes again\nBut this isn't how it was supposed to end\nAm I lost am I dead or simply stuck inside my head?\nI just want to be something again\n\nI need something cause I'm nothing\n\nIsn't it so fucked up that you could feel so dead inside\nBut have to keep a straight face and act like everything's fine\n\nI'm falling into your eyes again\nBut this isn't how it was supposed to end\nHow will you remember me when I am far out of reach?\nI'm just dust in the wind\n\nSo slow down and take a second to look back\nAnd wallow in your lies until you realize\n\nAt the end of this I will find peace within\nI'm just dust in the wind\nAm I lost am I dead or simply stuck inside my head?\nI'm just dust in the wind","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2o-90SbAets/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2o-90SbAets/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2o-90SbAets/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2o-90SbAets/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2o-90SbAets/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BVTV Music","playlistId":"UUc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","position":22,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2o-90SbAets"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/yXuF0yrQidse3ISyJ5zv54EOcIo\"","id":"VVVjMjd1VlZtY24yM1NHRFlMNXVJcE1RLi13Z09lZWJ1dDBF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-12T20:01:51.000Z","channelId":"UCc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","title":"Nerv - \"Enemy\" (Official Lyric Video) | BVTV Music","description":"Introducing: Nerv from Sacramento/Dallas/Atlanta.

Now everything I see is just as grey as when we first met. If this is what it's like living with a lie, I'd rather lose my sight than give you another second of my time. I hate you more than life itself and I wish I never learned to feel. Will the color return? Or is love just a wound that goes unhealed? Bleed me dry and leave. You were no different from the rest. And you're  no different from me. So for the first time in forever I won't let my hatred go unnoticed, cause in the light you were exposed and now you're just the smell of smoke in my clothes. How do I tell my friends that I always feel sick? And that I need their help cause I can't handle this shit. I'm spending too many nights on the edge of my seat. If you were in my shoes you'd fucking chop off your feet. You are every piece of broken glass I wish that I touched.

But currently you’ve allowed me to escape, replacing all self hatred with new born faith. I lie awake finally able to embrace the thought of a tomorrow that I don’t absolutely hate. I used to fall asleep wishing I had a disease. Erase me, and wipe the world clean. Set an anchor to my ankles and watch me drown. Hollow out you ear canals with my cries for help. Dive in and save me from myself. I just can’t help but to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt, knowing everything I love becomes infected. Love is the cancer, quarantine my affections and tell me you’re immune. How can I love you properly when I can’t even love myself? You were always a victim of my virus and the closer you get will just end with the lost of your health. I am nothing more than a terminal attachment. I am the virus, coursing your veins, burrowed in your lungs seizing every breath. I am the disease.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KqXmK9njxY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KqXmK9njxY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KqXmK9njxY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KqXmK9njxY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KqXmK9njxY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BVTV Music","playlistId":"UUc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","position":49,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4KqXmK9njxY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/_iLETgY6W93HHfYBr1exFVTnAkE\"","id":"VVVjMjd1VlZtY24yM1NHRFlMNXVJcE1RLll5VVk4S2sxRWZn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-11T19:22:30.000Z","channelId":"UCc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","title":"Andy Black - \"They Don't Need To Understand\" LIVE! @ Warped Tour 2017","description":"Watch Andy Black perform his hit single \"They Don't Need To Understand\" LIVE at Warped Tour 2017 in Phoenix, AZ!\n\nAdditional angles by:\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/OfficialCaliberTV\n\nCheck out Andy Black at:\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/OfficialAndyBlack\n\nFollow BVTV at:\nYOUTUBE: http://www.YouTube.com/BVTV\nTWITTER: http://www.Twitter.com/BVTV\nFACEBOOK: http://www.Facebook.com/BVTVmusic\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.Instagram.com/BVTVmusic","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YyUY8Kk1Efg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YyUY8Kk1Efg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YyUY8Kk1Efg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YyUY8Kk1Efg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YyUY8Kk1Efg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BVTV Music","playlistId":"UUc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","position":50,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YyUY8Kk1Efg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/GLtbGVnhpgNIH6eRQiZvQa7_L0I\"","id":"VVVjMjd1VlZtY24yM1NHRFlMNXVJcE1RLnE1SG9DOGhzMlFR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-15T19:03:12.000Z","channelId":"UCc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","title":"Dance Gavin Dance - \"We Own The Night\" LIVE! @ Warped Tour 2017","description":"Watch Dance Gavin Dance perform their hit single \"We Own The Night\" LIVE at Warped Tour 2017 in Phoenix, AZ!\n\nThumbnail photo by: Ellie Mitchell\nhttp://elliemitchellphotography.co.uk\n\nAdditional angles by:\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/OfficialCaliberTV\n\nCheck out Dance Gavin Dance at:\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/DanceGavinDance\n\nFollow BVTV at:\nYOUTUBE: http://www.YouTube.com/BVTV\nTWITTER: http://www.Twitter.com/BVTV\nFACEBOOK: http://www.Facebook.com/BVTVmusic\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.Instagram.com/BVTVmusic","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5HoC8hs2QQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5HoC8hs2QQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5HoC8hs2QQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5HoC8hs2QQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5HoC8hs2QQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"BVTV Music","playlistId":"UUc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","position":51,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"q5HoC8hs2QQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"DuHzAJ-eQIiCIp7p4ldoVcVAOeY/sPb8B03MBajgwTAd1D6ivf2iY5w\"","id":"VVVjMjd1VlZtY24yM1NHRFlMNXVJcE1RLkxqOXFBRDgzTzNv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-11T19:02:07.000Z","channelId":"UCc27uVVmcn23SGDYL5uIpMQ","title":"Veridian - \"Ink\" (Official Music Video)","description":"Introducing: Veridian from Reading, UK!
